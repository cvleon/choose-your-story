Forest it is. The sea with its silence was giving you the creeps. You walk a little slowly, pulling your sword from its hilt a little, just in case. Darkness enveloped you as you’re walking down a narrow path amongst the trees, hiding in plain sight from the indecisive clouds and the water. There’s only just enough light to see. You look around. There’s nothing but signs of normalcy here. Thankfully, there’s other life here. Squirrels, some birds, a rabbit here and there, a soft call of a hummingbird. You relax your step a little and think to yourself contentedly that this was a good choice. You continue walking along the path.

Not long after, that uneasy feeling starts creeping up on you again. You halt and turn around quickly. Was that a shadow? You look around but saw nothing. 

Hmm…it must just be a bird. You slowly continue walking. But you weren’t fully able to brush off the feeling that someone is watching you…

A minute passed and it happened again! But is a bird or another animal? Or a mysterious presence? 

Do you choose to ignore it and continue walking or pull your sword out and demand it to reveal itself?
