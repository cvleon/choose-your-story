# Choose Your Own Story/Adventure Game

An interactive story game where you (as the player) read text and choose options that lead you to a different aspect of the story.  Some options can result in character death while others lead you to the conclusion of the game, encouraging the player to choose wisely.

### Usage / How To Play 

* Play the game by running `python story.py` in your terminal (requires `Python 2`) 
* Once presented with story scenarios, choose which options/keys that are presented to continue the story
* Try to choose scenarios that will most likely lead to the full conclusion of the story

### Development

Edit the story files located in the `stories` directory and modify the `story.py` script to edit game logic.
