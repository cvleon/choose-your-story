# Choose Your Own Story/Adventure Game

This script is built using Python. It's an interactive story game where you (as the player) read text and choose options that lead you to a different aspect of the story.  Some options can result in character death while others lead you to the conclusion of the game, encouraging the player to choose wisely.
