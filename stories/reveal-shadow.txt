“Show yourself!” You pull your sword out. 

There was a pause. Your hands start to tremble. 

“I don’t fear you! Come out right now!” you say, hoping your voice doesn’t betray your fear.

You hear a sudden whoosh and you see a cloaked figure flying directly towards you from the trees. You raise your sword higher and take a swing at it. He dodges and flies to your right, hitting you across the face with his own sword. You fall straight to the ground from the impact. Now you’re even more determined to defeat this cloaked figure. He lands on his feet. You look up at his taut, patched up face. He has with empty sockets where his eyes are supposed to be. He nudges for you to get up and fight.

Fine. You want a fight? Let’s fight!

You and the cloaked figure (flying dead man? monster?) start battling. With a clash of swords, you and he engage in a dance of sorts, a dance for life. You twist, dodge, and attack with all the might years of training has given you. He’s good, you can admit. But you’re better. This is what you’re good at. This is what makes you feel alive.

Finally, you get to his blind spot and attack him straight into his chest. His eyes, despite its empty sockets, get wide when he realizes in that split second that he lost. He blows up in smithereens. 

Panting slightly, you stare into empty space where the man was standing mere moments ago. Life around went back as if nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Shaking your head, you continue walking, still with your sword raised. Just in case. 

You pass a clearing but still continue along the path ahead of you. After walking for about an hour on this path, you come across a small hut. There was light inside. But before you even put one more step forward, a man with the strangest clothes appear before you. He’s wearing a robe, a pointed hat, and holding a wand at you.

Do you run away or face the wizard?
