You accept her hands. Her lovely, beautiful, soft hands. By now, the singing is all you hear. You step further into the warm and welcoming water. You smiled. This is where you meant to be.

But a quickly as you have this thought, the singing turns into shrieking, hands into claws that start digging into your skin. The lovely face turns into a hideous beast growling at you menacingly. You try to escape it, pulling away from the force. The water crashes into your body, bringing you further down. You hold your breath while trying to fight those hideous claws that brings you closer to its body. You desperately try reaching for your sword. But itâ€™s no use; you struggle to hold your breath but unintentionally lets it go. The water starts filling your lungs and you lose consciousness. The last thing you see is your captor - the woman with the claws, now red eyes, and large fangs snarling at you.

You die without ever finding fulfillment, a trapped soul in the clutches of a beast.
