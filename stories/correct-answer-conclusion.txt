“Correct! Well done, you are worthy enough to pass through my land and find the conclusion to your quest,” he says approvingly.

You can’t believe your luck. You actually guessed right, for once! Giddy with delight, you shake the wizard’s hands enthusiastically. With a new spring in your step, you walk by the hut, the other skeletons, and his gardens. Soon enough you approach the end of the forest.

You look ahead and see that you’re still by the ocean. But there were waves and they crashed the shores, as if roaring in approval at your success. The sun was shining cheerfully. All looked well.

You look ahead and see the same masked stranger you saw in the beginning of your quest. You approach him and see him taking his mask off.

You do a double take. The he was a she! The woman had dark skin, wide eyes, and a soft face. She beams down at you.

“Well done! You did very well in your quest!” she says.

“The parchment said this quest will help me find the fulfillment I seek. What does that even mean?” you ask.

“Throughout this quest, you learned to trust your instincts even when your body and brain was aching to do the opposite. But you observed and you listened to yourself. Your soul never lies to you, my dear. You will go through much in life, as one always does. It will always be an ebb and flow of happiness, sadness, and anger. You will never be happy all the time. Similarly, you won’t be sad all the time. But the key to managing all of this and the key fulfillment is following your instinct. And learning to trust and listen to it. Hone this skill and you’ll find that instinct is the one thing that will never fail you.”

You stare at the woman in wonderment. She smiles back at your expression and bows respectfully.

You bow back. You feel a renewed sense of purpose that fills you with a sense of peace and contentment.

THE END.
