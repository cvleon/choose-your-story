Forest it is. The sea with its silence was giving you the creeps. You walk a little slowly, pulling your sword from its hilt a little, just in case. Darkness envelops you as you walk down a narrow path amongst the trees, hiding in plain sight from the indecisive clouds and the water. There’s only just enough light to see. You look around. There’s nothing but signs of normalcy here. Signs of life hurry past you - a squirrel collecting acorns, some birds chirping, a rabbit here and there. You relax your step a little and think to yourself that this path was a good choice. You continue walking.

Not long after, that irritating uneasy feeling starts creeping up on you again. You halt and turn around quickly. Was that a shadow? You look around but see nothing.

Hmm…it must be a bird. You slowly continue walking. But you weren’t quite able to brush off the feeling that someone is watching you…

A minute passed and it happened again! But is it actually a bird? Or a mysterious presence?

Do you choose to ignore it and continue walking or pull your sword out and demand it to reveal itself?
