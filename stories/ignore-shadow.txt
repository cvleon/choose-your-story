You choose to ignore it. You’re in a forest, after all! It's only natural that you'd hear some things you can't see. There are so many things crawling and flying around. It’s probably just a bird. You put your sword back in its hilt and continue walking.

“I’m being paranoid, yes that’s it,” you say aloud, as if trying to reassure yourself. 

But before you take another step, a cloaked figure with no eyes and patched skin comes flying from the trees, its sword pointing straight at you. Before you could react, you feel a piercing pain in your heart. He has stabbed you. 

You die bleeding on the forest ground, never finishing the quest you set out to complete.
