You choose the sea. Better to enter something familiar than something that’s unfamiliar. You continue walking along the quiet sea. You squint at the water as if willing it to produce waves. Nothing. What is happening…

Suddenly an angelic, haunting song surrounds the air, reverberating into your very soul. You halt and stare into the sea with your mouth agape. It’s a beautiful voice – a woman’s voice. And it sounded so terribly sad.

You look inside the eerily still water, which now almost touching your feet. You see a beautiful woman’s face with long flowing hair looking back at you. She looked so sad. Your face softened in empathy.  You want to go help her. She was weeping while singing, “fly into the sea, come here by me...” She looked pained and reached her arms out, as if calling for you. Entranced you begin to step into the water. The water feels so warm and comfortable. The clouds started clearing and the sun begins to shine brightly, as if the storm gods were also encouraging you to help her. The alluring lady looks eagerly at you and reaches her hands further out, while singing ever more quickly, “fly to the sea, come here by me…be lost in the sea, come here by me...”

Do you choose to go into the water? Or run far away from it?
