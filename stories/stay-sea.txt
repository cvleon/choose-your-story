You choose the sea. Better to continue along something familiar than enter something that’s unfamiliar. You continue walking along the quiet sea. You squint at the water as if willing it to produce waves. Nothing. What is happening…

Suddenly an angelic, haunting song surrounds the air, reverberating into your very soul. You halt and stare into the sea with your mouth agape. It’s a beautiful voice – a woman’s voice coming from under the water. It sounded so terribly sad.

You walk towards the sea and look inside the eerily still water, which now almost touching your feet. You see a beautiful woman’s face with long flowing hair gazing longingly back at you. She looks so sad. Your face softens in empathy. You want to do nothing but help this poor beautiful woman. 

She was weeping while singing, “fly into the sea, come here by me...” She looks pained and reach her arms out, as if calling for you. Entranced, you begin to step into the water. The water feels so warm and comfortable, as if welcoming you into its folds. The alluring lady looks eagerly at you and reaches her arms further out, while singing ever more quickly, “fly to the sea, come here by me...be lost in the sea, come here by me...”

Do you choose to go into the water? Or run far away from it?
