It's a dismal day. Clouds circle around the sky as if unsure whether to rain or not. You sigh in frustration and continue walking down the path alongside the calm sea. Too calm –  judging by the clouds you think suspiciously, narrowing your eyes. You pat your sword reassuringly, reminding yourself that you have protection. You reflect on how you came to be here. 

You were given a small parchment by a masked stranger and was mysteriously pulled to accept it by some unknown force. In the parchment, it writes in a small but neat writing, "follow this path and you will find the fulfilment you seek - but only if you choose your path wisely. You may face dangers along the way.” You look up and you see that the stranger has disappeared.

How predictably ominous. 

But you followed anyways. What choice do you really have? Plus it's not like you had much to do today. Fulfillment sounds nice, you think decidedly.

As you're walking, for what it seemed to be eons (though it's only been five minutes), you come across a fork in the road. Up ahead on the left, there's a dark dense forest. On the right, you can choose to continue walking alongside the coast. 

What do you choose?
