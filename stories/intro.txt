It's a dismal day. Clouds circle around the sky as if unsure whether to rain. You sigh in frustration and continue walking down the path alongside the calm sea. Too calm –  judging by the clouds you think suspiciously, narrowing your eyes. You pat your sword reassuringly, reminding yourself that you at least have some protection. You reflect on how you came to be here.

You were given a small parchment by a masked stranger and was mysteriously pulled to accept it by an unknown force. In the parchment, it writes in a small but neat writing, "Follow this path and you will find the fulfillment you seek - but only if you choose your path wisely. You may face dangers along the way.” You look up and you see that the stranger has disappeared.

How predictably ominous.

But you followed anyways. What choice do you really have? Plus it's not like you had much to do today. Fulfillment sounds nice, you think decidedly.

As you're walking, for what it seemed to be an hour (though it's only been five minutes), you come across a fork in the road. Up ahead on the left, you see a dark dense forest. On the right, the path continues alongside the coast.

What do you choose?
