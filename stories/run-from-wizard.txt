Duh! You run as fast as you can! After that monster, you’re not taking any chances.

“Get back here you whippersnapping trespasser!”

You look back and don't see him anymore. He's vanished! You take your sword out and keep running. BAM! You run right into him. Gathering your wits, you slash your sword at him.

The wizard’s face twists in fury at the attack and takes his wand out. You hear him yell our something incomprehensible. All you see is white light and then blank.

You die before you even realize what had happened.
