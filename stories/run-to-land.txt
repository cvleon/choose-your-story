“Snap out of it!” Something tells you. You blink and look back at the lady, who’s looking even more desperate. But you start noticing the darkness underneath her. The water starts to burn. With an increasing sense of foreboding, you step back from the water. You don't think twice. You run far away from the sea as your feet allow and head straight into a narrow path that looks to be heading into the forest.

You run straight into the woods and keep running, getting cuts and bruises along the way, not caring to dodge the branches and twigs. Suddenly you arrive at a clearing. You double over, heaving and panting, Your heart is racing wildly.

Your eyes adjust to the relative darkness and you look around. Nothing seems amiss. Trees, a woodpecker by the tree, a squirrel collecting its acorns. You sigh a breath of relief. I should’ve picked the forest when I had the chance...what a fool I am to answer the siren’s calls.

You take deep breaths to calm yourself down and look around. You see another path on your right. You decide to walk towards it and clutch your sword. This time, you will be prepared. You feel your heartbeat cooling down.

After walking for about an hour on this path, you come across a small hut. There was light inside. But before you even put one more step forward, a man with the strangest clothes appear before you. He’s wearing a robe, a pointed hat, and a raised wand.

Do you run away or face the wizard?
